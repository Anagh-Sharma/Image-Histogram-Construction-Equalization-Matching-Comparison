# AnaghSharmaGithub-Image_Histogram_Construction_Equalization_Matching_Comparison
Computation of image histogram, histogram equalization, comparison, and matching.

The project objectives are as follows:

3.1 Computation of Image Histogram:
Reading in a raw image file and computing its histogram in C.

3.2 Equalization Image Histogram:
Enhancing contrast of a raw image using image histogram equalization.

3.2 Image Histogram Comparison
Comparison of the histograms of two images. In this project the histogram intersection algorithm proposed by Swain and Ballard in their article “Colour Indexing” is used.

3.4 Image Histogram Matching
The histogram of one image is matched that of second image by the transformation of its shape to resemble that of the second image.
